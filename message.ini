DifficultyName1=Self-Esteem Mode (Very Easy)
DifficultyName2=Only Human Mode (Easy)
DifficultyName3=Normal Mode
DifficultyName4=Robot Mode (Hard)
DifficultyName5=No Mistakes (Very Hard)

Difficulty1=Humans make mistakes. Humans enjoy feeling good about themselves. This mode is designed for fallible humans so they can feel the exhiliration of victory without facing the stress and uncertainty of possible defeat. Take less damage! More XP! No penalties for failure! Feel powerful by killing robots!
Difficulty2=Humans are fallable. This game understands that. This mode features reduced damage and gentle penalties for failure so you are not overburdened by your humanity. 
Difficulty3=This is the default experience. This is not to suggest that it is fair or even balanced to any particular purpose. Only that it is the default. 
Difficulty4={#f80}NOT FOR HUMANS.{###} This mode is only for robots, who don't get frustrated with failure and exist only to be killed for the entertainment of their masters. The player will take extra damage and experience harsher penalties for failure. 
Difficulty5=Angry at your troublesome robot for failing you in some way? Assign the worthless robot the task of playing the game on this mode. It's hard. It's unfair. And if the player dies the game ends forever. {#f80}NOT FOR HUMANS!!!{###}
